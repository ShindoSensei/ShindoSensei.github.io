                  <p>
                    In the last couple of years, I've been in the events trade and worked with clients including GIC, UOB, MPA, LV and more. I also took a year out to pursue entrepreneurship in events - an experience that culminated in the clinching of a Panasonic contract.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I've always enjoyed creating things and the events field provided a great canvas for this - From the conceptualisation of an event experience to the final deployment of its infrastructure. However, I found that the industry had a few limiting factors, making it hard for a startup to scale. For instance, to execute an overseas event, one had to fly multiple times with a team to the event site, expending capital and time resources that could otherwise be used to fine-tune the event blueprint or build its infrastructure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In my quest to discover a field that offers scaling efficiency, I discovered the holy grail that is tech!

                  Landlord/tenants currently pay a hefty commission when engaging an agent. Yet, a lot of an agent's work, namely sourcing properties and paperwork, can be replaced by code. Roborent aims to reduce costs for both the landlord and tenant, improving the overall rental ecosystem.

                     This was the first collaborative project we each experienced. The main difficulty was not the individual parts but rather, how we could manage the workload as a team and minimise merge conflicts. To tackle this, for the first 1-2 days, we sat next to each other and managed each feature merge together. Over time as we grew more comfortable, we were able to merge confidently and communicate remotely. Skype's share screen feature was helpful when resolving merge conflicts too!

              <p>
                One day, my girlfriend was watching a korean drama on Viki and came across an english subtitle that was a bit too literal. This is a common problem in fan-subbed foreign shows, as fans are usually not professional translators.
                Being the good boyfriend that I am, I delved into the contribution structure of Viki in an attempt to solve this issue.
              </p>
              <p>
                I discovered that for each of Viki's video content, there was on average 1-2 final editors. So I thought, why not crowdsource the final editing of subtitles too? CrowdSub aims to fill this void by having an upvote system, allowing the community to float the most appropriate subtitle edits to the top and alerting final editors of the most pressing improvements required.

                   This was the first project I did involving API consumption, Node.js & AJAX (for partial rendering). To tackle these, I designated sufficient time for each part and did some extensive research before I began coding. In addition, I focused primarily on a MVP to prevent feature creep - a dangerous thing to have considering my first foray into the aforementioned fields.

              Believe it or not, Pulse was initially built to target gym instructors, enabling them to tell if, for instance, a cycling class was pushing themselves! After speaking to friends with UX experience, gym instructors and my girlfriend(an omniscient and avid gym-goer), my team figured that experienced instructors need only look at the faces of the class to tell if it was time to rev up the exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              We decided that instead of focusing on training intensity, why not focus on training safety? That was when we fixated on the military - since the Singapore Armed Forces(SAF) is notorious for their focus on safety.

                  <span class="buildTools">Process:</span> This was a 10 day project built in collaboration with my friends Iskandar and John. We began by sketching wireframes of the website and the Entity Relationship Diagram on paper. We also mapped out the structure of the React components. The Github kanban board was helpful to spread the work around. John, the IOT maverick, focused on building up the MQTT framework whilst Iskandar and myself built the API backend to prepare it for IOT synchronisation and front end consumption. Upon completing the IOT and backend portions, we proceeded onto the front end and split the work up by pages. We built each of our own parts in git feature branches, merging onto a common development branch only after each feature was stable.

                 This was the first full-scale project we did with React.js. Working with React was difficult at first as we had to switch our thinking from a traditional front-end approach to a state-based approach. In addition, Rails' synchronous nature proved difficult to integrate with MQTT IOT which initially caused the app to hang when it was called. To solve this, we ran Rails Active Jobs and sent the MQTT job to the background, allowing users to move on with other app functions.

            This was a mini project built to teach myself and a few others the basics of React and Socket.io. Further to that, due to its transient nature(no database), it could also be a rendezvous point for secret lovers or an exchange point for bad bad things... hmmm.. perhaps I should rethink the transient part.

I then started coding component by component, starting with the easiest one(connection status label) to build confidence before going to the harder components(e.g. message component).

               This was the first time I had to self-learn and use React.js and there was some difficulty in understanding its concepts. To prepare myself, I went through 14 videos of Seth Rogen's ReactJS Basics found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPT3bFIwJYA&index=1&list=PL55RiY5tL51oyA8euSROLjMFZbXaV7skS" class="sethRogen">here</a>.
